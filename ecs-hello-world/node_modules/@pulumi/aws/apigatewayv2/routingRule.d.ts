/**
 * Resource for managing an AWS API Gateway V2 Routing Rule.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ### Basic Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const example = new aws.apigatewayv2.RoutingRule("example", {
 *     domainName: "test.example.com",
 *     conditions: [{
 *         matchHeaders: {
 *             anyOf: {
 *                 header: "X-Example-Header",
 *                 valueGlob: "example-value-*",
 *             },
 *         },
 *         matchBasePaths: {
 *             anyOfs: [
 *                 "example-path",
 *                 "another-path",
 *             ],
 *         },
 *     }],
 *     actions: [{
 *         invokeApi: {
 *             apiId: "example-api-id",
 *             stage: "example-stage",
 *             stripBasePath: true,
 *         },
 *     }],
 *     priority: 1,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import API Gateway V2 Routing Rule using the `routing_rule_arn`. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aws:apigatewayv2/routingRule:RoutingRule example arn:aws:apigateway:us-east-1:123456789012:/domainnames/example.com/routingrules/rule1
 * ```
