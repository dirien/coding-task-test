/**
 * Provides a CloudWatch Logs subscription filter resource.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as aws from "@pulumi/aws";
 *
 * const testLambdafunctionLogfilter = new aws.cloudwatch.LogSubscriptionFilter("test_lambdafunction_logfilter", {
 *     name: "test_lambdafunction_logfilter",
 *     roleArn: iamForLambda.arn,
 *     logGroup: "/aws/lambda/example_lambda_name",
 *     filterPattern: "logtype test",
 *     destinationArn: testLogstream.arn,
 *     distribution: "Random",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Using `pulumi import`, import CloudWatch Logs subscription filter using the log group name and subscription filter name separated by `|`. For example:
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import aws:cloudwatch/logSubscriptionFilter:LogSubscriptionFilter test_lambdafunction_logfilter "/aws/lambda/example_lambda_name|test_lambdafunction_logfilter"
 * ```
